Welcome to the course **“Linked Open Data for the Humanities”**! This course provides a practical introduction to the world of Linked Open Data (LOD) and is specifically designed for researchers and students in the humanities. However, the concepts behind linked open data are just as transferable to other research 
areas, which means that this course is also aimed at all interested learnes who have no experience in the humanities. Also you dont need any coding experience or other theoretical background knowledge. You will learn everything you need in this course.

The concept behind a carpentry lesson is very practical, so this course will give you different hands-on tasks to solve to learn the theoretical concepts to provide an inclusive and interesting learning experience.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Model your research data with RDF.
- Identify the advantages and disadvantages of Linked Data.
- Use RDF in your own research practice.


## What is Linked Open Data?

Linked Open Data (LOD) is a method of structuring and interconnecting data on the web in a machine-readable format. It builds upon existing web technologies such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF) to create meaningful relationships between different datasets. This allows data to be linked across various sources, facilitating improved accessibility, integration, and reusability. In this course, you will learn what RDF is, how to create a file in the RDF format, and what possibilities this provides. You will also learn how to use this format to analyze your data and gain a brief insight into its potential applications
