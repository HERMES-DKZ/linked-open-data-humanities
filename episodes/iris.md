## How URIs Solve Ambiguity  

The method used in LOD to resolve these ambiguities is IRIs. You may be familiar with the term URI—IRIs are simply an extension of this concept.  

A **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)** provides a unique reference for an entity, ensuring clarity in data relationships. Instead of relying on **titles**, which may appear in multiple datasets, we use a **globally unique identifier**.  

For example:  

- **Van Gogh’s Wheatfield with Cypresses (Metropolitan Museum of Art)**: `https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436535`  

- **Van Gogh’s Wheatfield with Cypresses (Wikidata)**: `https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q201852`  

By linking datasets through these **URIs**, we can ensure that different records truly refer to the same artwork.

## What is Linked Open Data (LOD)?  

**Linked Open Data (LOD)** is a method of **structuring and publishing data** that enables connections between different datasets. By following the principles of **Linked Data** and ensuring **open access**, LOD allows for **seamless data integration across different domains**.  

Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the **World Wide Web**, formulated **four key principles** for Linked Data:  

1. **Use URIs** to uniquely identify resources.  

2. **Use HTTP URIs** so that resources can be accessed online.  

3. **Provide structured and useful information** in standardized formats.  

4. **Link to other relevant data** to establish relationships between datasets.

## Summary  

- **The subject-predicate-object model helps structure information clearly.**  

- **Ambiguity in data arises when multiple records share the same name without unique identifiers.**  

- **URIs solve this problem by providing a unique reference for each entity.**  

- **Linked Open Data connects different datasets, enabling richer research.**
