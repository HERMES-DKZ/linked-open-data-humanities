:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What are IRIs, literals and a blanknodes and when to use them?
- How to write down RDF?
- What is Turtle?
- What is a vocabulary and a namespace?
- What is RDF Schema?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Differentiate between the concepts of IRIs, literals and blanknodes?
- Know when to use IRIs, literals and blanknodes.
- Write down RDF in turtle format?
- Understand what a vocabulary is used for in linked open data.
- Remember where to look for the concepts of the RDF schema vocabulary and their definitions.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Different concepts in RDF

* IRI
* Literal
* Blanknode


## Serialization formats

A serialisation format is the answer to the question of how to write things down in RDF so that the machine understands them. In short
Turtle is an example for such a format.

Turtle example
```

##namespaces
##statements
```
Other common serialization formats:

* RDF/XML
* JSON-LD



You do not have to know all the serialization Formats, there are plenty of converter tools on the web, for example the [EASYRDF Converter](https://www.easyrdf.org/converter) or the [RDF Converter by Zazuko](https://converter.zazuko.com/).
