# Linked Open Data for the Humanities

Welcome to the online course **“Introduction to Linked Open Data for the Humanities”**! This course provides a practical introduction to the world of Linked Open Data (LOD) and is specifically designed for researchers and students in the humanities.

Throughout the course, various topics will be covered, including the fundamentals of LOD, modeling, creating LOD from structured data such as CSV, querying with SPARQL, and publishing the generated data. As the course continues to evolve, content and focus areas may be adjusted or expanded.
